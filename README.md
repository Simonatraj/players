# Players – CS50 SQL Problem Set

This repository contains my complete solutions to the **Players** problem set from CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL.

## Overview

In this challenge, I explored Major League Baseball’s player data from 1871 to 2023 by writing SQL queries to answer questions about players' backgrounds, careers, and statistics. The project focuses on data selection, filtering, aggregation, and sorting.

## Files

- `players.sql` – Contains all SQL queries for each assignment question
- `players.db` – Provided SQLite database
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## ERD / Database Structure

The `players.db` file contains a single `players` table with columns for player ID, first and last names, batting/throwing hand, weight, height, debut/final game dates, and birth details (year, month, day, city, state, country).

## How to Use

1. Open `players.db` with a SQLite client or the command line.
2. Open `players.sql` to review all solved queries for the assignment.
3. Run the queries from `players.sql` to reproduce the results and explore the data.
